## 📞 Quick Reference

**What is a React Hook?**
- A JavaScript function that "hooks into" React features
- Only work inside functional components
- Must start with "use"
- Must be called at top level (not in loops/conditions)

**Why Hooks?**
- Simpler than class components
- Better code reuse
- Easier to understand
- Modern React approach

**The 8 Essential Hooks:**
1. useState - Add state
2. useEffect - Side effects
3. useReducer - Complex state
4. useContext - Global state
5. useCallback - Memoize functions
6. useMemo - Memoize values
7. useRef - DOM access
8. Custom - Your own hooks
